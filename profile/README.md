## 🧠 About Balsamiq Cloud

Created by **Balsamiq Studios**, this platform focuses on **speed, simplicity, and brainstorming clarity**.  
Unlike high-fidelity prototyping tools, Balsamiq Cloud emphasizes **concept validation** — helping teams agree on structure before diving into visuals.  

Designers, PMs, and developers can collaborate in real time, annotate wireframes, and share feedback seamlessly.  
The **desktop editions for Windows and MacOS** let you work offline and sync later, ensuring continuity in any workflow.  

Its familiar “sketchy” style communicates that everything is still in progress — ideal for early UX discussions and agile teams.
